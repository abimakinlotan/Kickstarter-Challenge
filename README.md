#### Challenges
- Large Datasets: Working with large data was a big challenge. I quickly got familiar with the data and and understood the purpose of the Project so that I could filter the information necessary to complete my analysis.
- Time Constraint

- Conclusions
1. The months (April & May) had more successful outcomes probably because the season is changing and consumers are more likely to enjoy plays and theater outings in warmer temperatures.
2. There were fewer to no canceled projects in the Crowd-funding campaigns.

- Conclusion: Campaign goals with a budget less than $10,000 had more chance to be successful.

- Recommendation:  Keep Louise's budget under $10,000.
